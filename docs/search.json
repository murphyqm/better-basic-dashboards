The main difference between using the Quarto website layout instead of a dashboard layout is that by default, the website will show the code being used.\nFor example:\n\nPlotData\n\n\n\nfig = px.scatter(data, x=\"avg_r\", y=\"actual_volume\",color=\"Result\",symbol=\"Result\",\n                marginal_x=\"histogram\",marginal_y=\"rug\",log_y=True,\n                color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Vivid, opacity=0.5,\n                labels={\n                     \"avg_r\": \"Mean intrusion radius (m)\",\n                     \"actual_volume\": \"Intrusion volume (m^3)\",\n                     \"Result\": \"Model result\"\n                 },).update_layout(\n    template='plotly_white'\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nshow(display_data, lengthMenu=[10, 20, 50, 100])\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Unnamed: 0\n      percent_rounded\n      percent_geochem_preserved\n      actual_volume\n      avg_r\n      non-uni\n      uni\n      mantle_temp\n      int_temp\n      mean_it3\n    \n  \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.3 from the internet...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of wanting to share a finished piece of data communication, this might not be desirable. This is easily remedied by passing the argument #| echo: false to the code block. This can also be set for the entire page, leading to output like below:\n\nPlotData\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Unnamed: 0\n      percent_rounded\n      percent_geochem_preserved\n      actual_volume\n      avg_r\n      non-uni\n      uni\n      mantle_temp\n      int_temp\n      mean_it3\n    \n  \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.3 from the internet...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros and Cons\nThis might not have the usual look of organised cards as you have come to expect from a dashboard, but can give a very clean and professional appearance to your data story relatively quickly. Certain features are only available through the dashboard layout option, such as the value cards in Example Dash 2: Data breakdown\nYou might need to do some experimentation to discover what layout best suits your data and the message you are trying to convey.\n\nDo you expect users to mainly visit the site via computer or mobile phone?\nHow much interactivity do you require vs. how much text content do you anticipate?\nWhat format are your figures in, and are they better showcased by either layout?\nWhich layout allows you to follow better accessibility practice?"

    "text": "Webapps and dashboards are becoming an ever more popular way to present and share the results of data science projects. While dashboards can be a great way to communicate findings, they also present a range of challenges when it comes to accessible UI design.\n\n\nTo start off, I’d really recommend you read this brief blogpost on web accessibility standards from Jumping Rivers.\nOnce you’ve scrolled through, this website provides you with much more detailed information, including introductory videos. This resource contains a slightly overwhelming amount of information, so I would recommend dipping in and out.\nOk, so what does this mean for you? Well, many web apps built with common R and Python libraries do not meet WCAG standards out-of-the-box. How can you test this? If you’ve built a web app, you can toss the URL into a tool like WAVE and see how many error messages you get.\n\n\n\nOk, so what does this mean for you?\n\nBy default, without customising css and html content, it is likely your Python or R webapp does not meet accessibility guidelines (see this great deep dive into RShiny accessibility again from Jumping Rivers).\nThis means that some visitors to your website, particularly those using a screen reader, may not be able to parse your content.\nIt also might mean that your webapp displays poorly, with low contrast, and too-small text font, making it difficult to navigate by sight.\n\nWe should be building a web that is accessible and inclusive to all. You are likely building your webapp because you want to share the results of your research: don’t cut off a cohort of your audience by forgetting accessibility! Also, it’s very likely that you are breaching your institution or funders requirements by producing web output that is not accessible!\n\n\n\n\nIf you already have a webapp, use WAVE to assess it’s current accessibility.\nIf you haven’t a webapp yet, read the UK Government Design Principles before you start designing one. Then, head over to the Guidance page.\n\n\nWebapps can often look amateurish as researchers are not UI/UX designers. One way to improve the appearance of a specific research group’s webapps is to implement a standard style guide that applies across all apps.\nThis can be as simple as:\n\nDefining what theme should be used as standard across all apps (for example, Bootswatch themes are available across RShiny, Shiny for Python, and Dash apps), which quickly provides a cohesive appearance and outsources design choices.\nProviding custom scss and css theming files to build on top of the default base theme, for example pulling in branding colours. For example, you may want the navigation bar to always have a white background, so that your logo can be placed on it while adhering to branding guidelines.\nProviding a footer template with correct copyright and license notices."
